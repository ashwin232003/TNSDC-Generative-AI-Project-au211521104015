# Fashion Dress GAN

## Overview

This repository contains code for training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic images of fashion dresses. The GAN is trained on the Fashion MINIST dataset and is capable of generating high-resolution, color images of various dress styles.

## Setup

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependency 

## Usage

### Loading Dataset

- Load the Fashion MINIST dataset containing images of fashion items, including dresses.

### Preprocessing

- Perform preprocessing steps on the dataset:
  - Reshape images to the desired dimensions.
  - Convert grayscale images to RGB format if necessary.
  - Normalize pixel values to the range [-1, 1] to ensure numerical stability during training.

### Build Generative and Discriminator Models

- Define the architecture of the generator and discriminator networks:
  - Design the layers of the generator to transform random noise into realistic fashion dress images.
  - Design the layers of the discriminator to distinguish between real and fake images.

### Loss and Optimizer Initialization

- Define the loss functions and optimizers for both the generator and discriminator:
  - Use binary cross-entropy loss for the discriminator to differentiate between real and fake images.
  - Use binary cross-entropy loss for the generator to fool the discriminator.
  - Initialize optimizers, such as Adam, with appropriate learning rates for updating the network weights.

### Training Loop

- Iterate over a predefined number of epochs:
  - For each epoch, iterate over mini-batches of the training dataset.
  - Train the discriminator:
    - Feed real images through the discriminator and compute the loss.
    - Feed fake images generated by the generator through the discriminator and compute the loss.
    - Update the discriminator's weights using backpropagation.
  - Train the generator:
    - Generate fake images using random noise input.
    - Feed generated images through the discriminator and compute the loss.
    - Update the generator's weights using backpropagation.
  - Monitor training progress and loss values.

### Generate Image

- After training, use the trained generator to generate new fashion dress images:
  - Input random noise into the generator network.
  - Obtain generated images as output.
  - Optionally, post-process generated images for visualization or user feedback.
